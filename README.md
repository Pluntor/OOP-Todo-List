# My version of ToDo List created using OOP, probably much to refactor :)

This version includes:
- creating tasks with deadline date,
- moving done tasks to done section,
- filtering and higlighting active tasks,
- highlighting done tasks that matches phrase written in text input field.

The main window is written in polish language, but feel free to change it to your national language :)

Explore, rebuild, update.

ENJOY!
